### Target Shooter VR
The game I am developing is a simple virtual reality shooting experience using Unity and Google Cardboard. Players can hit the ball onto a target, and the goal is to hit a randomly selected point on the target, with the player's accuracy determining their score. As balls collide with the target, scores are calculated based on proximity to the center of the board, with higher points awarded for closer hits. The game encourages skill development by allowing players to refine their aim over time, aiming for the highest possible score.
In our class discussions, we have defined a game as an interactive experience with a set of rules, a goal, and an outcome that can be measured or evaluated. This VR game provides immediate feedback, as players can see where the ball lands and receive a score based on their performance. This feedback is essential in creating the vibrant experience of a game.
What’s more, there are clear rules in the game: the player must shoot balls, the balls are subject to physics like force and gravity, and the scoring system depends on how close the ball lands to the target’s center. These rules form the framework within which the player must operate and provide structure to the experience.
The game also has a measurable outcome in the form of a score. By determining the points based on how close the hit is to the target's center, the game incentivizes players to improve their performance. The scoring system adds a layer of competition, even if it's self-driven, as players seek to outperform their previous attempts.
This game combines elements of skill, chance, and feedback to create a structured environment where players are motivated to improve and achieve a higher score, making it a simple yet effective game.
